# Aurora Improvement Proposals (AIPs)

<!-- TODO: Create a proper section on the forum to discuss AIPs or other standards. -->

Before you initiate a pull request, please read the [AIP-1](AIPs/aip-1.md) process document. Ideas should be thoroughly discussed in [Aurora Forum](https://forum.aurora.dev/categories). Feel free to propose less formed ideas on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/dEFJBz8HQV).

This repository tracks ongoing improvements to Aurora Engine and Rainbow Bridge. This includes protocol specifications, standards, processes and workflows.

## Mission

The goal of the AIP project is to document standardized protocols for Aurora Engine, Rainbow Bridge and applications and to document them in a high quality and implementable way. It is self-contained and should allow third parties to integrate with public interfaces or be compliant to current standards.

## AIPs
