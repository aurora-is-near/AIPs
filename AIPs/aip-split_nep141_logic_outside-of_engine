## Abstract

At the moment, the NEP-141 logic is one of the main parts of the Aurora 
contract. NEP-141 - implements the fungible token logic, which is the 
link between the Ethereum and NEAR ecosystem tokens.

Due to the specifics of the original goals of the Aurora contract, 
the logic of NEP-141 has become an integral part of the core contract itself.

However, further use and development of Aurora showed that this solution 
has a number of shortcomings, which are proposed to be solved in this 
proposal.

In the most general form, these include:

* improved security (due to a number of vulnerabilities found recently)

* more flexible changes (this will not require updating the entire aurora contract)

The result of the split should be a separate contract that the Aurora 
contract interacts with through cross-contract calls.
